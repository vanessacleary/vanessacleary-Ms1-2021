<p>Balance is an online Yoga and Meditation class platform. It is just over 12 months old and looking to grow its membership base.

## Design:

**Wireframes**
* I mainly stuck to the wireframe designs, all changes that were made were to improve the website user expierence and aesthetic.

  * Desktop home page wireframe can be found [here](/docs/wireframes/desktop-homepage.png)

  * Desktop log-in page wireframe can be found [here](/docs/wireframes/desktop-login.png)

  * Mobile home page wireframe can be found [here](/docs/wireframes/mobile-homepage.png)

  * Mobile log-in page wire frame can be found [here](/docs/wireframes/mobile-login.png)

**Colors**

* I created a colour scheme of Indian red and White with shades of apricot to for clickable elements on the website. I chose to keep the website crisp and clean with block colors. As the website is a membership service I wanted to ensure key information was not missed and there was very little distractions on the website. 
      * Red has over 50 color shades and is color that symbolizes passion, the heat of energy, passion and love to name a few.
      * Yoga & Meditation is part of peoples lifestyle filled with passion, engery and love so after the the colour change I was delighted to use red for the accessability it brought to the website and meaning of color aligns with the brand. 
      * The color white symbolizes White purity cleanliness, freshness, and simplicity. It also associated with a new beginning or a fresh start whic aligns with what new concept Balance is offering for with online classes.

**Typography** 
* I chose 'Nunito' from Google Fonts. I chose this font because:
  * The soft and curvy form works well with the brand name, its playful and suits the softer and artistic vibe that Yoga and Meditation has.
  * It's also a sans-serif font which is more accessible for people with dyslexia. Sans-serif is the back-up font if Nunito fails.

**Imagery** 
* All images on the website are of professional quality and fully licensed. All images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Google images](https://images.google.com/) Please see ['Credits](#Credits) section for more information on licenses.

## Features

<p>The entire site is responsive for all screen sizes and both pages have the same responsive Navbar and Footer.
The website was created using Bootstraps 4.6 grid system.</p>

**The website has 2 pages:**

1. [Homepage](https://vanessacleary.github.io/vanessacleary-Ms1-2021/) (seven sections)
2. [Login/Register page](https://vanessacleary.github.io/vanessacleary-Ms1-2021/log-in.html) (three sections)

**Features:**

### Homepage 
1. A  fully responsive **'nav bar'** for users to nagivate through the website easily. [desktop](/docs/features/nav-bar.JPG) & [mobile 1](/docs/features/navbar-mobile.JPG) & [mobile 2](/docs/features/nav-bar-mobilep-2.JPG)
2. A hero image with the price per month and a strong CTA. The 'Free Trial' CTA is essential to capture the attention of visitors who are hesitant to switch to online yoga. 
2. The **‘About’** section is key for visitors to understand how the company was created and the direction Balance is going in. It also is inviting as it showcases the different styles of yoga available and the lifestyle demographics of memebers. The ‘Testimonial’ CTA is a key feature here to draw the visitors attention to how much current members love Balance.
3. The **‘How it Works’** section is key for visitors to get a snapshot of how Balance works and what is on offer.
4. The **‘Meet the Team’** section is an essential feature to draw the visitor's attention to the instructors, its purpose is to let visitors know who will be hosting the classes and that they are real people behind the virtual class. 
5. The **‘Testimonial’** section is one of the most important features. Reviews and Testimonials are growing more and more important as consumers are more savvy than ever when it comes to spending money and want to know they are receiving a quality product or service. 
6. The **'gallery'** was added for aesthetic purposes and demonstrates the yoga moves that are included in the classes
7. The **'footer'** contains essential ‘Contact’ & 'Social media' information and a ‘Newsletter sign up’ in order for Balance to update recipients and further market the brand. 
8. The **'Login and Register'** feature was created to provide users witha clear path on how to sign in to the website to begin or continue their Balance journey. 

**Section 1: The hero image with jumbotron and CTA:**
* I chose a less striking image for the hero image as I wanted the Balance concept, price and free trail CTA to be the first thing visitors see. I had tested other images and they took away from the key information. The current image was still distracting however adding a shadowed overlay helped mute out the image and draw more attention to the key information and CTA. 

  * The follwoing user stories addresses this section 
   * *As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.*
    * *As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily see the price.*
    * *As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to sign up for a free trial to get an idea of what the membership is like.*
    * *As a returning visitor, I want to easily be reminded what Balance is about and how it works.*

![Hero section](/docs/features/hero-section.JPG)

**Section 2:**
* The ‘About’ section is an information section, detailing how Balance was formed, the target audience, the different styles of Yoga and Meditation available and direction Balance is going in. The ‘Here what our members have to say’ button is an essential CTA to draw visitors' attention to how much current members love Balance. The copy was created by me.

  * The follwoing user stories addresses this section 
   * *As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.*

![About section](/docs/features/about-section.JPG)

**Section 3: Join :**

* The **‘Join Section’** states clearly:
  * How to join
  * What is included in a membership
  * Information on classes
  * The icons in the heading are also visual aids for visitors who may need them. The icons were made responsive using hover.css to add some movement to the site.
  * The copy was written by me. 

    * The follwoing user stories addresses this section 
      * *As a First Time Visitor, I want easily know find out about the organisation, how to join and how to sign up.*

![How it works section](/docs/features/join-section.JPG)

**Section 4: Meet the Team:**
* Having the team on the home page is essential for visitors to know who will be guiding their Yoga and Meditation practice. It also states the combined year of teaching experience and information on how to login and where to view the class information. 

![Meet the team section](/docs/features/team-section.JPG)

**Section 5: Testimonials**
* This section is to inform visitors of how current members feel about Balance and help consumers make an informed decision. The carousel was one feature I wanted to incorporate on the website to bring the website to life with some movement. 

   * The follwoing user stories address this section 
      * *As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their memebers think of them and see if they are trusted.*
      * *As a returning user, I want to easily see testimonials.*

![Testimonial section](/docs/features/testimonial-section.JPG)

**Section 6: Gallery**
* The gallery was planned for in the project inception when the wire frames were created. Its purpose is to make the website visually pleasing and showcase some of the more common poses that are practiced at Balance. In order to reduce the scroll depth on mobile only two images will appear.

![Gallery section](/docs/features/gallery-section.JPG)

**Section 7: The footer on both homepage and login and register page**
* The footer ended up being different to the wireframe. A newsletter sign up form is a better feature than a contact form for an online business. It is easy to sign up and helps Balance build brand awareness and reach consumers in their inbox.The contact information is hyperlinked for good user experience and one-click step to make contact on mobile and email.The social media icons bring visitors to all their channels so users can get further information and see the content and followings on each platform.

 * The follwoing user stories address this section 
    *  *As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their memebers think of them and see if they are trusted.*
    *  *As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to make contact with any queiries or questions I have.*
    *  *As a returning visitor, I want to easily be able to contact Balance for any questions or queries I may have.*
    *  *As a member, I want to easily see contact & social media information for Balance.*

### Login and Register page

**Section 1: Alert box**
* The **'alert box'** informs users how to avail of the free trial, it serves as a further prompt for users to register.

![Alert section](/docs/features/alert-section.JPG)

**Section 2: Login and registration forms**
* I decided to keep this page clear, concise and fuss free. This section has two clear forms and directs users to which form they need. The login form is for existing members and the registration form is for new members to sign up. The fixed-top Navbar directs visitors back to the home page to re-look at any information if they wish.

 * The follwoing user stories address this section
   * *As a member, I want to visit Balance and easily log-in to attend a class, take a class on demand or see the class schedule.*

1. Confirmation emails when a user registers to Balance. 
1. Confirmation emails when a user signs up to the Balance newsletter.
1. A chat bot for instant chat to answer any queries, give additional information or to chat to a team member.
1. Videos with snippets of online yoga class.

## Testing

### Validator
The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to validate both pages of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

* W3C Markup Validator Homepage - [Results](/docs/testing/desktop-home-page-validation.JPG)
  * The homepage passed with 0 errors
* W3C Markup Validator Login page - [Results](/docs/testing/desktop-login-page-validation.JPG)
  * The Login page passed with 0 errors
* W3C CSS Validator - [Results](/docs/testing/css-validator.JPG)
  * The CSS passed with 0 errors
  * I also put the CSS through  [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to improve the CSS and add vendor prefixes. The CSS validation came back again with 0 errors but had some warnings. I was assured the CSS was correct by slack team members & mentors and to document the warnings.
    * The warnings can be found [here](/docs/testing/warnings.JPG)
 
### Performance

  * Lenovo IdeaPad S340-14IIL
  * Samsung A70
  * Toshiba satellite 

### Accessability 

* [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) gave the website a score of 96% accessability for both mobile and desktop. 4% was lost for *'Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.'* This was flagged earlier on in the project and changes were made to increase the score to 96%. Futher updates to the project would look to improve the website accessability and gain a score of 100%.

### Known Issues and Bugs

1. The gallery images squash on iPad screens with screen size '768x1024' when tested on google dev tools. I was uable to test this on an actual iPad. The issue does not occur on iPad pro when tested using Google dev tools. I tired to resolve this using many different media queries, display options and vendor prefixes and I could not fix the issue in time.
1. On large screens the middle gallery image is cut off at the end. 
1. The gallery images do not shrink when the 'zoom' is reduced.
1. The Nav bar was causing an issue on desktop and mobile. When a Navlink was click it would navigate to the correct section however the Navbar would cover the section heading which I have since learned is common with single page websites - this has since been fixed. 
1. The collapasable Nav menu for mobile did not collapse when a link was clicked on, this issue was resolved by adding data-toggle and data-targets to each nav link however when the Nav bar is clicked on for desktop it flashes like it is collapsing like the menu  shoule, I would look to improve this in the future.
