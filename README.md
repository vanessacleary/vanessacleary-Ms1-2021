# Miletsone Project 1 | Balance - Virtual Yoga & Meditation Classes
Balance is an online yoga and meditation class service. It is just over 12 months old and looking to grow its customer base.

Balance was created as a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic when all in person classes were cancelled. Balance is now a commercial business looking to expand its client base and compete in the virtual yoga class market on both price and offering.

# Features

#Technologies used

### Languages used

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
The project uses HTML5 to make up the basic elements and structure of the website.

[CSS3] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
I have used CSS3 to add my own custom styling and to change default bootstrap styling where and when needed.

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

[Bootstrap 4.6] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
The Bootstrap framework was used to help build the responsive structure of the site and add default styling.
It was also used to import JavaScript and Jquery which was used for the pop up modal sign up form and the collapsible navbar.

[Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
Hover.css was used on the Font awesome icons in the ‘How it Works’ section to add the pulse-grow 2D transition while being hovered over.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Google fonts were used to import the 'Titillium Web' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
Font Awesome was used on both pages on the website to add icons for aesthetic UX purposes and visual aid purposes. 

[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

Git
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.


Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

Google Chrome Developer Tools
I used Google chromes built in developer tools to help with the styling of the site, selecting colors and to troubleshoot any bugs I found.

[Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
This was used to check responsiveness on different screen sizes and create the showcase image for the project.

Google Lighthouse
I used Google lighthouse to test the performance of my site.

# Testing
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
