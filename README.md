## Miletsone Project 1 | Balance - Virtual Yoga & Meditation Classes
Balance is an online Yoga and Meditation class platform. It is just over 12 months old and looking to grow its membership base.

Balance was created as a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic when all in person classes were cancelled. Balance is now a commercial business looking to expand its membership base and compete in the virtual yoga class market on both price and offering.

**Wireframes**

* Desktop log-in page wireframe can be found ![here](/docs/wireframes/desktop-login.png)

* Mobile home page wireframe can be found ![here](/docs/wireframes/mobile-homepage.png)

* Mobile log-in page wire frame can be found ![here](/docs/wireframes/homepage-login.png)

**Colors**
I created a colour scheme of red and white with shades of apricot to for clickable elements on the website. I chose to keep the website crisp and clean with block colors. As the website is a membership service I wantes to ensure key information was not missed and there was little distractions on the website. 

**Typography** 

**Imagery** 

## Features

**The website has 2 pages:**
1. Homepage  
2. Login/register page

* The homepage had seven sections.
* The login/register page has three sections.
* The entire site is responsive for all screen sizes and both pages have the same Navbar and Footer.
* The website was created using Bootstraps grd system.

**Features:**
1. A hero image with the price per month and a strong CTA. The 'Free Trial' CTA is essential to capture the attention of visitors who are hesitant to switch to online yoga. 
2. The ‘About’ section is key for visitors to understand how the company was created and the direction Balance is going in. It also is inviting as it showcases the different styles of yoga available and the lifestyle demographics of memebers. The ‘Testimonial’ CTA is a key feature here to draw the visitors attention to how much current members love Balance.
3. The ‘How it Works’ section is key for visitors to get a snapshot of how Balance works and what is on offer,
4. The ‘Meet the Team’ section is an essential feature to draw the visitor's attention to the instructors, its purpose is to let visitors know who will be hosting the classes and that they are real people behind the virtual class. 
5. The ‘Testimonial’ section is one of the most important features. Reviews and Testimonials are growing more and more important as consumers are more savvy than ever when it comes to spending money and want to know they are receiving a quality product or service. 
6. The gallery was added for aesthetic purposes and demonstrates the yoga moves that are included in the classes
7. The footer contains essential ‘Contact’ information and a ‘Newsletter sign up’ in order for Balance to update recipients and further market the brand. 

**Section 1 - The hero image with jumbotron and CTA:**
* I chose a less striking image for the hero image as I wanted the Balance concept, price and free trail CTA to be the first thing visitors see. I had tested other images and they took away from the key information. The current image was still distracting however adding a shadowed overlay helped mute out the image and draw more attention to the key information and CTA.

**Section 2:**
* The ‘About’ section is an information section, detailing how Balance was formed, the target audience, the different styles of Yoga and Meditation available and direction Balance is going in. The ‘Here what our members have to say’ button is an essential CTA to draw visitors' attention to how much current members love Balance. The copy was created by me.

**Section 3 - How it works:**

* The ‘How it Works Section’ states clearly:
  * How to join
  * What is included in a membership
  * Information on classes
  * The icons in the heading are also visual aids for visitors who may need them. The icons were made responsive using hover.css to add some movement to the site.
  * The copy was written by me. 

**Section 4 - Meet the Team:**
* Having the team on the home page is essential for visitors to know who will be guiding their Yoga and Meditation practice. It also states the combined year of teaching experience and information on how to login and where to view the class information. 

**Section 5 - Testimonials**
* This section is to inform visitors of how current members feel about Balance and help consumers make an informed decision. The carousel was one feature I wanted  to incorporate on the website to bring the website to life with some movement. 

**Section 6 - Gallery**
* The gallery was planned for in the project inception when the wire frames were created. Its purpose is to make the website visually pleasing and showcase some of the more common poses that are practiced at Balance. In order to reduce the scroll depth on mobile only two images will appear.

**Section 7 - The footer**
* The footer ended up being different to the wireframe. A newsletter sign up form is a better feature than a contact form for an online business. It is easy to sign up and helps Balance build brand awareness and reach consumers in their inbox.The contact information is hyperlinked for good user experience and one-click step to make contact on mobile and email.The social media icons bring visitors to all their channels so users can get further information and see the content and followings on each platform.  

**Login and Register page**

**Section 1 - Alert box**
* The alert box informs users how to avail of the free trial, it serves as a further prompt for users to register.

**Section 2 - Login and registration forms**
* I decided to keep this page clear, concise and fuss free. This section has two clear forms and directs users to which form they need. The login form is for existing members and the registration form is for new members to sign up. The fixed-top Navbar directs visitors back to the home page to re-look at any information if they wish.

## Future Features

**As I progress with my studies I would like add:**

1. Confirmation emails when a user registers to Balance 
2. Confirmation emails when a user signs up to the Balance newsletter
3. A chat bot for instant chat to answer any queries, give additional information or to chat to a team member.

### Known Issues and Bugs

1. The bottom of second gallery image cuts of on large screens
2. The gallery images overlap on iPda screens with screen size 768x1024 when tested on google dev tools. I was uable to test this on an actual iPad. The issue does not occur on iPad pro when tested using Google dev tools. 
3. The Nav bar was causing an issue. When a Navlink was click it would navigate to the correct section however the Navbar would cover the section heading.
